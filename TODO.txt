TODO:

- Non-hardcoded maps
- More maps
- GUIs to do everything
- Inventory
- Put privilege restrictions on chatcommands
- Fix the alive_players variable not working right
- A bigger and better map, ideally with hills, few trees, no caves, some rivers, big villages here and there, and 500x500 size
- Random loot spawning in chests in predefined places (inside houses)
- Add a proper licence and give credit to the creators of the mods used
- Make guns zoom in with a crosshair while rightclick is held
- Header, screenshot, and icon
- Polish the game
- Rewrite the main mod from scratch (less than 100 lines, should be easy)
